# CopyFiles

This is a program that takes a list of SKUs, then uses each SKU in this list to search a folder structure of your choice. Each file it finds inside the folder structure, that includes the same SKU in its file name, will be copied to the new location; being renamed in the process. This naming convention was required by the new DAM software used.
